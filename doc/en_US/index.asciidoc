== Monitoring

=== Introduction
This plugin allows you to recover system datas and display those on the Dashboard.

Initially, this plugin was created to monitor only Jeedom Mini and Jeedom Mini +. But to meet a high demand, it has been made compatible with a Jeedom installed on a VM (Virtual Machine) or a Synology NAS or etc ...

==== Compatibility :

To my knowledge, here is a non-exhaustive list of hardware / compatible distribution:

- Jeedom Mini, Mini + (probably the Center / Pro)
- Raspberry Pi
- Cubieboard
- Banana Pi
- Virtual Machine (VM)
- Synology NAS
- Linux (should be compatible with a lot of Linux distribution)
- Specific distributions: OpenELEC, LibreElec, RasPlex and OSMC

==== Data visible on the Dashboard :
[horizontal]
- *Distribution* : Name and version of the Linux operating system, 32 or 64 bit architecture, and the microprocessor type
- *Started since uptime* : inform for how long Jeedom is started
- *System load* : Load average (more information see FAQ)
- *Memory* : total RAM and used
- *Network* : MB rate of transmitted and received data
- *Total and used disk space* : Disk space of the SD card or hard disk for Synology, VMs and NAS
- *CPU* : core number, associated frequency and temperature (temperature only if compatible)
